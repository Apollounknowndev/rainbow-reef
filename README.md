Hi! This is my (Apollo's) personal fork of Rainbow Reef for Fabric 1.21.8. 

It's mostly feature complete, but with a few notable issues:

- Shark and Ray tails are very jittery, not sure what causes it.
- Spawn eggs haven't been updated to the 1.21.5+ unique textures. For now, I've given them all the untinted old texture.
- The "Collect all <entity> variant" advancements from the mod don't work.
